MapLibre GL Native is planning a migration to Metal, Apple's graphics framework, for rendering on iOS mobile devices.

We are happy to announce that Stamen Design, with technical leadership by Wet Dog Weather and funded from AWS, have begun planning for the modularization of MapLibre rendering and support for the Metal renderer.

Stamen is a leader in Vector Tile Cartography, and map renderers like MapLibre tie all the parts of the modern mapping stack together. Steve Gifford from Wet Dog Weather will be the technical lead for this project, and Stephanie May, Damon Burgett, and Camilla Mahon from Stamen will support the migration.

AWS identified that their customers have a strong need for a Metal map renderer and are glad to support the MapLibre community with this contribution.

Everybody is welcome to participate in the discussions around the migration. Have a look at the ongoing Design Proposal and share what you think at https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native/pull/547.

We are looking forward to this collaboration, and hope this can act as a catalyst to bring the project, its contributors, and MapLibre users into the Metal future.
